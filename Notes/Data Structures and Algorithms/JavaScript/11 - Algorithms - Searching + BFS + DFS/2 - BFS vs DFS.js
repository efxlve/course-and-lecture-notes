// Exercise

// If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
// BFS

// If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare:
// BFS (DFS will take long)

// If the tree is very wide:
// DFS (BFS will need too much memory)

// If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
// DFS

// Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
// DFS

// Finding the shortest path:
// BFS
